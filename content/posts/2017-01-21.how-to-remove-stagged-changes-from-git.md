To remove your stagged changes or to undo your last `git add` command you can simply use `git reset`. Running the below command will simply remove all files from your staging area:

```bash
$ git reset
```

In case you want to remove only a specifc file(s) than you can mention the name of file(s), like this:

```bash
# To remove a single file
$ git reset filename.ext

# You can also remove bunch of files using simple rejex expressions
$ git reset content/*.png
```

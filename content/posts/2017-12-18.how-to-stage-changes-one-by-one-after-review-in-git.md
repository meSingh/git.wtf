When working on your code there are some situations when you might have to push a simple fix or a piece a code. Normally, it is recommended to create a new fix branch from your master and push it back but some times we kind of go lazzy. In those movments I simply do the changes and add them one by one using the following command:

```
$ git add -p
```

I believe it’s worth menthioning how I got to know about this nice little helper.
